With over ten years of experience in the field, Maurits Fornier combines legal expertise, technical knowledge, and design thinking. His background in litigation forms the foundation for a practical approach to structuring legal information.

As founder of Patroon, he focuses on developing strategic frameworks and technical solutions for complex legal challenges. His work ranges from litigation visualization for law firms to interactive compliance tools for large organizations.

Maurits' approach is characterized by a combination of:

- Legal information architecture and pattern recognition
- Technical implementation, including AI integration
- Visual frameworks and interactive solutions

This methodology has led to collaborations with law firms, regulatory bodies, and corporate legal departments across the Netherlands and beyond. Representative projects include:

- Strategic visualization for Google Ad Platform litigation
- Interactive documentation for CSRD regulations
- AI-supported compliance tools for the pharmaceutical sector

At Patroon, we work from the conviction that effective legal communication isn't about simplification, but about thoughtful structure supported by appropriate technology.
