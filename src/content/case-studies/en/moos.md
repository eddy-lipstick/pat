    quote: 'Moos does everything differently from the traditional construction sector, and we wanted our contracts to reflect that. The goal was less paper, less text, more visuals. This aligns with our industry, where people build things and spend much less time dealing with documents.'

Their legal documentation did not align with this vision.'
