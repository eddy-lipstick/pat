    firstParagraph: 'LC Energy builds solar energy systems on agricultural land. Partnerships with farmers are essential for this. We redesigned the term sheet and process explainer to make the entire collaboration process transparent. No fine print or hidden clauses, but clear communication that builds trust.'
    remainingText:
      - 'Instead of marketing materials, we chose a minimalist design that emphasizes the commitment to transparency. The documents are in A3 format, perfect for discussion at the kitchen table where changes can be made together.'
      - 'The result is a set of documents that are not only legally sound but are also truly understood by all parties involved. This is how we make sustainable energy projects accessible to everyone.'
