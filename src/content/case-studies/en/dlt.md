    firstParagraph: 'Legal tech is profoundly changing the legal sector. From AI research tools to platforms that make legal services accessible to everyone. To visualize this ecosystem, we chose an organic form: moving blobs that represent the different areas. The soft shapes and fluid movements symbolize how boundaries between categories blur and companies continuously evolve.'
    remainingText:
      - 'We divided companies into five main categories: Research, Contract & Document Automation, Legal Workflow, Access to Justice, and Legal Process Outsourcing. Through the interactive design, users can zoom in on specific areas and discover connections between different players.'
      - 'Besides the interactive map, we created a series of video interviews with founders, telling the story behind the innovations. These personal stories provide context to the visualization and show how entrepreneurs are transforming the legal sector.'
