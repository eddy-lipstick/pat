  - title: 'From Theory to Practice'
    firstParagraph: 'To make the complex theory concrete, we created FreshFood B.V.: a fictional Dutch family business that produces ready-made meals. Through FreshFood, we show what sustainability reporting looks like in practice. What do you need to report about your CO₂ emissions? How do you map your water consumption? What do you write about working conditions in your supply chain?'
    remainingText:
      - 'In the Navigator, users can constantly switch between theory and practice. For each topic, you first see the theory, and immediately after that how FreshFood has approached this. This makes it immediately clear how to apply the rules. We deliberately chose a medium-sized production company, as many of the first reporting companies will recognize themselves in this. FreshFood struggles with the same challenges as they do: from mapping CO₂ emissions in the supply chain to reporting on working conditions for seasonal workers.'
      - 'This example has another advantage: it shows that sustainability reporting is not just about large multinationals, but also about ordinary Dutch companies that are taking steps towards sustainability one step at a time.'

  entries:
    - phase: 'Research & Analysis'
      description: 'We started with a thorough analysis of the ESRS regulations and existing information materials. There was a lot available, but it often remained superficial. It became clear that there was a need for more in-depth, practical information.'

    - phase: 'Information Architecture'
      description: 'We developed a clear structure that guides users step by step through the ESRS requirements. To make the theory concrete, we created a fictional example company: FreshFood. By consistently featuring this example company, abstract regulations become tangible and practically applicable.'

    - phase: 'Design & Development'
      description: "The interactive PDF was developed with a focus on ease of use. We created infographics that clarify complex concepts and built interactive elements that allow users to switch between theory and practical examples. FreshFood's fictional case study consistently illustrates how companies can apply the theory."

    - phase: 'Testing & Refining'
      description: 'Together with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, we organized two rounds of user testing: first with stakeholders, then with sustainability experts from the business community. Their feedback led to practical improvements such as additional checklists, example tables, and clarification of complex concepts through the FreshFood example.'
