  - title: 'From procedure to understanding'
    firstParagraph: 'An international trial involves many procedures, parties, and trajectories. For next of kin and the public, it is crucial to understand these processes. In collaboration with Marieke de Hoon from PILPG (Public International Law & Policy Group), we developed a series of visualizations that explain step by step how this case proceeds.'
    remainingText:
      - 'The visualizations bring structure to complex information. They show the connection between different procedures and clarify which steps are taken when. Legal terms are carefully explained without compromising precision.'
      - 'The result is a set of communication tools that contributes to transparency and understanding. They support next of kin in following the case and help the public understand the procedures.'
