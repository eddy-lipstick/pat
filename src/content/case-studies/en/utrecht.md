title: 'From legal document to understandable privacy statement'
introduction: >-
  How do you make privacy statements understandable for more than 360,000 residents?
  The Municipality of Utrecht asked Patroon to transform their complex privacy statement 
  into an accessible document. We developed an interactive privacy plaza that guides 
  residents step by step through the various processing procedures.

      The insight provided to citizens and the scalability of this concept appeals 
      to the jury: other municipalities can follow this example, which will help 
      citizens quickly and easily understand what happens with their data.

    quote: >-
      We used B1-level language throughout. A term like "automated decision-making", 
      which is quite essential in the GDPR, is not understood by the average person.

    firstParagraph: >-
      The municipality processes personal data in more than 90 different processes. 
      From parking permits to social assistance applications. All these processes 
      need to be clearly explained to residents. We therefore developed a new structure 
      that is not based on the municipal organization, but on the resident's world.

        In the privacy plaza, users can easily navigate to the situation that is 
        relevant to them. Legal terms like 'Fiscal parking enforcement' and 
        'Administrative law instruments' were translated into understandable 
        language without losing their legal meaning.
      - >-
        The result is a privacy statement that not only meets all legal requirements 
        but is also truly understood by Utrecht residents. This makes privacy 
        something tangible that fits with a modern, transparent government.

  entries:
    - phase: 'Analysis'
      description: >-
        The Municipality performs hundreds of tasks for residents. We mapped all 
        these processing procedures and focused on the 90 most important processes.
    - phase: 'Structuring and testing'
      description: >-
        We developed a structure for the 90 processing procedures, where the 
        organizational structure of the municipality is not leading, but rather 
        the user's perspective. This structure was tested with a representative user group.
    - phase: 'Development and testing'
      description: >-
        We developed a prototype of the privacy plaza and tested it with residents 
        of the Municipality of Utrecht at city hall. This provided valuable insights. 
        For example: few people knew the meaning of 'data'. We changed this to 
        'personal information'.
    - phase: 'Implementation'
      description: >-
        We developed a toolkit that allows the municipality to easily create new 
        privacy statements themselves. And trained the administrators in using this toolkit.
