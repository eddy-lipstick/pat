## Introduction

Using visually improved contracts and services is essential to impress the client with your design. Our last post in this legal design basics series is about visualizing contracts.

### **Why it matters**

People drive with emotions. Emotions are feelings of satisfaction. Making legal documents and information more engaging is one of the most important things you can do. In today's world, aesthetics are equally important to usability.

Emotion is measured by the satisfaction someone gets from their experience with your product. Think about why you enjoy unboxing videos or the difference in emotional satisfaction between buying and using an Apple product versus a different brand.

Visualizing is a powerful tool for improving communication, reducing misunderstandings, and enhancing the user experience.

## **Fonts**

Fonts are something that makes your client want to read your contract. Imagine reading a 32-page-long contract written in Comic Sans font. ü•∂ Even if your content is gold, no one will read it because of the bad font.

### **Why it matters:**

Good fonts = good reading experience. Choosing the right font for legal documents significantly impacts readability, accessibility, and professionalism. Older generations use Serif fonts such as Times New Roman or Georgia because they are often preferred for legal documents due to their classic and traditional appearance.

But this doesn't mean we must use these fonts to gain trust or heaviness. Instead of "Times New Roman," "Playfair Display," or "Space Mono," it's better to use "Arial," "Verdana," "Open Sans," "Georgia," "Helvetica," or "Roboto."

_Both of them are usable, and their legibility is often perceived better than other classical fonts such as "Times New Roman" and "Arial."_

## **White Space**

White space helps readers transition between points and articles without missing essential information.

In legal contracts, white space is the area around and between the text, paragraphs, and other document elements intentionally left blank. White space is essential in legal contracts because it improves readability, comprehension, and the overall user experience.

## **Line Height and Letter Spacing**

Line height and letter spacing adjustments are essential in texts because they directly impact readability. Well-designed contracts significantly enhance user experience and comprehension by making the text easier to read, visually appealing, and accessible.

_Line height and letter spacing are important elements for better readability._

1. **Line height:** A line height of 120-150% of the font size is generally considered reasonable. For example, if the font size is 16 pixels, a line height of 19-24 pixels would be suitable.
2. **Letter spacing:** Avoid tight letter spacing as it makes text difficult to read. Similarly, excessive spacing can negatively impact readability. A safe range is usually **0 to 5% of the font size.**

## **Text Alignment**

In general, left alignment is better for legal contracts than justified alignment because justified alignment can create uneven word spacing and rivers of white space. However, we often use justified text if the program blocks the river effect. Adding more words to a contract to address this isn't ideal since less is more. üå±

_If your justified text lacks enough words, it can create rivers like this._

## **Colors**

Colors are like the paintbrushes of legal design‚Äîpowerful and emotive. They can convey messages, emphasize crucial details, and establish visual hierarchy. However, it's essential to use colors thoughtfully and strategically.

- üîµ Blue exudes trust, stability, and professionalism.
- üî¥ Red serves as a warning or alert.

Choose hues that align with the tone and purpose of the document while being mindful of accessibility for color blindness.

### **Why it matters:**

Like an artist painting a masterpiece, apply the right amount of color in the right places. **Done right, colors can transform a legal document from a mundane black-and-white agreement into a work of art that inspires trust and confidence. üë©‚Äçüé®**

## **Icons**

Icons are simple, recognizable visual symbols that enhance clarity and visual appeal in legal documents.

### **Why it matters:**

One picture is worth a thousand words. Icons transform complex concepts into navigable paths. For example, a handshake icon can represent an agreement, and an exclamation mark signals important information.

_Some icons that we use in our contracts._

### Key benefits of using icons:

1. **Clarity and Visual Communication:** Icons provide visual cues that help convey meaning and improve clarity.
2. **Enhanced User Experience:** Icons break down dense text, making contracts easier to navigate.
3. **Better Recall:** Icons are more memorable than text alone.
4. **Universal Appeal:** Icons help overcome language or cultural barriers in international documents.
