## Start with the fundamentals

Before diving into design, ask yourself three questions:

- What are the key points you need to convey?
- Who needs to understand them?
- When do they need to understand them?

These answers form the foundation of your visual strategy. They help you focus on what matters most.

## Timing is everything

Visual communication isn't just for the pleadings. Our research shows the most effective strategies use visuals throughout the litigation process:

- Pre-litigation: Build understanding with clients and assess case strength
- Written submissions: Support and clarify your arguments
- Oral hearings: Make complex points memorable and clear

## Choose your approach

Different challenges need different solutions. Here are the most effective approaches we've seen:

1. For complex timelines

- Start with a clear chronology
- Layer in key events
- Add supporting documentation links

2. For technical concepts

- Break down complex processes
- Use step-by-step explanations
- Include relevant comparisons

3. For financial data

- Focus on key numbers
- Show relationships clearly
- Highlight important patterns

## Common pitfalls to avoid

1. Don't overwhelm
   More isn't always better. The best visuals often simplify rather than complicate.

2. Start early
   Creating visuals at the last minute rarely works. Build them into your strategy from the beginning.

3. Stay consistent
   Your visuals should tell one coherent story. Consistency in design helps build understanding.

## Making it work in practice

Here's a practical implementation checklist:

1. Early case assessment

- Identify key complex issues
- Map out critical narrative points
- Plan visual needs across the case timeline

2. Team integration

- Involve key team members early
- Ensure everyone understands the visual strategy
- Plan review and feedback cycles

3. Client communication

- Use visuals in client meetings
- Get client input on clarity
- Adjust based on feedback

## When to bring in experts

Sometimes you need specialist help. Consider external support when:

- Technical complexity is high
- Stakes justify the investment
- Internal resources are stretched
- You need fresh perspectives

## Measuring success

How do you know if your visual strategy is working? Look for:

- Improved client understanding
- Clearer team communication
- More effective presentations
- Stronger argument reception

## Next steps

Building an effective visual strategy takes time and thought. But the impact on your case can be significant.
