Maurits co-presented with Michael Arch, Senior Managing Director at FTI Consulting, delivering a 45-minute session titled "Effective Visual Arguments: Dos and Don'ts" as part of Group Lecture D.

## Presentation Focus

The presentation examined how visual communication principles can be strategically applied across four phases of arbitration:

- **Preparation Phase:** Internal strategy development and case analysis
- **Written Submissions:** Complex argument communication to tribunals
- **Oral Hearings:** Live presentation and advocacy
- **Post-Award/Public:** Enforcement and market communication

The speakers demonstrated practical examples from real arbitration cases, showing how cognitive science principles can improve legal advocacy effectiveness.

## Conference Theme

Dutch Arbitration Day 2025's theme focused on the intersection of neuroscience and legal decision-making. The conference explored how understanding cognitive processes can enhance advocacy strategies and tribunal decision-making in complex international disputes.

Maurits's presentation emphasized that visual communication isn't about simplifying arguments, but about organizing complex information strategically to work with how tribunals actually process and retain information.

## About the Collaboration

The joint presentation showcased expertise from both legal design and technical arbitration perspectives. Michael Arch brought infrastructure arbitration and delay analysis expertise, while Maurits contributed legal design methodology and cognitive science application.
