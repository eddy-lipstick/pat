At Patroon, we make complex legal processes manageable by breaking them down into clear, interactive steps. Our interactive guides combine ease of use with legal accuracy.

## Our approach

We first analyze the complete process and identify where users get stuck. Then we develop an interactive guide that leads users step by step. Through continuous testing and iteration, we ensure the guide works intuitively for all users.

## Applications

- Contract generation wizards
- Compliance check tools
- Legal intake forms
- Procedure guides
- Onboarding flows
- Due diligence checklists
