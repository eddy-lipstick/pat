At Patroon, we make complex data flows and privacy rules understandable through interactive visualizations. We map how data flows through organizations and which privacy rules apply where.

## Our approach

We first analyze the data flows within your organization and between systems. Then we map the relevant privacy rules and link these to specific data flows. Through interactive visualizations, we make this complex matter comprehensible for all stakeholders.

## Applications

- Interactive data flow visualizations
- Privacy framework mapping
- Cross-border data transfer analysis
- System integration mapping
- Compliance documentation
- Privacy impact assessments
