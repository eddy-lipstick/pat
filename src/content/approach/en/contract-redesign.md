At Patroon, we restructure B2B contracts to better align with business needs. By optimizing language, structure and navigation, and adding visuals, we create contracts that are understood and trusted more quickly.

## Our approach

We start with a thorough analysis of the existing contract and interviews with key stakeholders. Then we optimize the language and structure, add visual support for complex clauses, and create a clear navigation structure. The result is a contract that remains legally sound while being much more accessible to the business.

## Applications

- Master service agreements
- Framework agreements

- License agreements
- SaaS terms
- Distribution agreements

## Benefits

- Faster contract review by the business
