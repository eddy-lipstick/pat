    firstParagraph: "An employment contract is often the first formal contact between employer and employee. By integrating sustainability into it, it immediately becomes clear that it's a core value of the organization. We developed an agreement that goes beyond legal requirements and provides concrete tools for sustainable behavior."
    remainingText:
      - 'The agreement integrates sustainability into various aspects of work: from mobility and remote working to lunches and training. Through the use of clear icons and infographics, the sustainability aspects are emphasized, making the document not just legally binding, but also inspiring.'
      - 'The result is an employment agreement that is both legally sound and practically applicable. The document directly contributes to behavioral change and strengthens the sustainable corporate culture.'
